A repository for my resume.

Uses [[http://orgmode.org][Org-mode]] and a custom style sheet.  Every CV/Resume package has it's own environments and it's a big pain to combine them and customize them.  I figured, it would be easy to write my own style-sheet and use good old org-mode.

Requires [[http://www.ctan.org/pkg/enumitem][enumitem package]] if you are using lists.
